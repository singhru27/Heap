Project Overview:

Visualizer for a Heap.

Note, this uses JavaFX and is only natively compatible with Java 8

Run Instructions:
Include the four included JARs as external JARS. Run app.impl.App to use the visualizer.
Alternatively a POM file has been included if looking to use Maven. cs0160.jar and nds4.jar are custom made local JAR files, and thus will need to be added to your local Maven repository (make sure to match the artifact ID given in the POM file).
